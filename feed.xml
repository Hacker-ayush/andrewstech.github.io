    As some of you may have noticed the site has once again changed. We are now hosted on GitHub and located at our root domain. I will be posting new updates soon. In the meantime why don't you have a look at my current project <a href="https://alpha-video.andrewstech.me/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">(alpha-video)</a>. Or join me on <a href="https://discord.gg/Ye2a4UY" target="_blank" rel="ugc">Discord</a>. Stay creative and I will be posting soon.
